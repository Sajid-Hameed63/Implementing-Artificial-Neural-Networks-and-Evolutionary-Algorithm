# Implementing-Artificial-Neural-Networks-and-Evolutionary-Algorithm
Implementing  Artificial  Neural  Networks  and  Evolutionary  Algorithm  to  classify  the  linearly  non-separable data.
Artificial intelligence is powerful branch of computer science. And nowadays participating a lot
in problem solving and machine learning. In this project, we are solving classification problem
with the help evolutionary algorithm and neural networks. We were given a non-linearly separable
data set. And neural networks are very good at the classification of data points into different
regions. We are using evolutionary algorithm for the production of new weights from old ones by
doing crossover and mutation. Our model will stop learning when it will be succeeded in its
learning otherwise it will do crossover and mutation on individuals and follow the process to
achieve more and more accuracy in classifying the all data points.
